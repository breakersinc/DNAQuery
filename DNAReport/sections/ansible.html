                    <p>Configuration management is increasingly important, with the server footprint increasing as organisations leverage the power of the cloud. Using centralised, automated tools to apply configuration to these disparate machines in a controlled manner allows IT teams to maximise productivity whilst ensuring consistent delivery of solutions to the business.</p>  
                    <p>Ansible is a leader in the configuration management area, providing robust mechanisms for applying configuration to servers. However, the internal credential management capabilities of Ansible are fairly limited, and it is not uncommon to see hardcoded credentials within playbook files. As with application servers this represents a severe risk - which is amplified by the fact that such playbooks are often published to code repositories where any authorised users can view the code. In the worst cases, plaintext credentials can end up being published to public code repositories such as GitHub, with catastrophic consequences. Understanding where these credentials exist, and ensuring they are properly managed, is key to avoiding this risk.</p>
